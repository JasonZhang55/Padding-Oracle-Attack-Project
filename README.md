# Padding-Oracle-Attack-Project
Padding Oracle Attack implementation on MAC-then-Encrypt scheme

Problem 3:
When the attacker tries to execute a padding oracle attack on TLS and DTLS, he cannot decide whether he got a correct padding or not merely depending on the return value of the sever. Because no matter padding correct or not, the attacker will get the same value from the server. However, I think the attacker can relies on the time channel introduced by the difference processing time between TLS records with correct and incorrect padding. Because, if the attacker sends blocks with incorrect padding, the sever will return 0 once it gets an incorrect padding check. On the other hand, if the attack sends blocks with correct padding but incorrect message, the padding check step will be correct. Then the server will calculate the correctness of the HMAC of the message. Thus, the whole processing time for the blocks with correct padding will be much longer than those with incorrect padding, since calculating HMAC is time-consuming. Therefore, the attacker can tell whether he got a correct padding or not based on the differences in timing due to the extra processing time for HMAC.
